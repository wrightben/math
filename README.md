## Teaching Math to Young Students and Professionals who struggle with it

Much of daily-use math is symbolic. Symbolic math is a language, which complicates the otherwise very simple and intuitive *actual* math.

Getting okay at math requires practice. Math textbooks are little help. They're written in a manner that makes them difficult to understand. If that doesn't seem discouraging, remember that half of the math problems are missing their corresponding instructions for solving. Not even the answers are included. Think about that: **Half** of the math problems in *instructional* math books sold to *students* have no instructions and no answers. 

Teachers, students, parents, and taxpayers in the U.S. just accept this, even as we collectively encourage young people to pursue education, especially in math-dependent degrees, and allocate millions to help them.

Khan Academy, unlike most textbooks, has simplified math instruction. The problems are easier. They've incorporated modern user experience in the presentation of examples, and use rewards to create and encourage study habits.

The improvement I'd suggest to Khan Academy is teaching math symbolism in conjunction with, but secondary to, the fundamental skills of addition and subtraction—Like a computer might do math. Logs, as my primary example, are essentially division, though symbolism makes them seem much more complicated.
