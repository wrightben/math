### Step 1

**R != 0**

( [1,2] A T [4,8] ) x 4 = [4,8] T A [1,2]

If R cannot be zero, it also cannot be greater than 2, because any greater number would result in a carry.

**R = [1,2]**<br />
A = [0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] when R = [1]; S = [4,5,6,7, ...]<br />
A = [0,1,3,4] when R = [2]; S = [8, ...]<br />

When R = 2, A < 5; When A >= 5, A will carry to R, pushing R from 8 to 10, which isn't possible.

### Step 2
