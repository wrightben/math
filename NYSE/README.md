### Theory
#### Consider: 
Purchase stock on Jan 1. Sell on Dec 31. Assume 3% (or market rate) appreciation over the year.

Now consider the fluctuating price of your stock during the year. Buy and hold strategies do not exploit this volatility. 

Purchase additional shares when the market price is below the price paid. Sell all shares when the market price is above the price paid.

Use cycles of 2%. Or *lower* if your position supports it.

### Misconception and misunderstandings

- A common misconception is that trading on variable intervals is the same as speculative "market timing". It isn't exactly, because low-percentage upward-trending volatility is *expected*.
- Buy-and-hold strategies (long-term, risk-averse, non-speculative) presume an average rate of appreciation. No one invests long term with the presumption that the market is perfectly variable, such that they have a 50% or greater chance of getting an average rate of depreciation.
- Buy-and-hold strategies (long-term) DO go with diversification. Exploiting variable intervals does not seem consistent with diversification.

Diversification is merely using your money to own stock in different companies. Because it's impossible to know which companies may fail over a long-term investment cycle, picking several different companies might prevent a total loss of capital. It's presumed not every company in a diversified portfolio will have an average rate of depreciation.
