## Poker/Auto

Writing code to learn and auto-play poker.

### To-Do List
- [x] Play n hands: n = 500,000
- Create a list of questions below:
	- [ ] Do the best hole cards usually become the winning hand if no one folds?
		- [ ] How much "insight" should be used when comparing hole cards to each other or to the shared cards?
			- [ ] Should hole cards be compared to each other using probabilities adjusted by the knowledge of the other hole cards?
	- [ ] Is betting *a language* or is it *maths*?
	- [ ] What attributes are necessary to codify a player?
	- [x] Which hands win most often (when no one folds): Two Pair, 30% of hands
	- [x] Is it necessary for auto play to have hands fold? No.
	- [x] Is it worthwhile to play the same hand using every player as the dealer. Only if betting is calculated.
		- [ ] How do intermediate likelihoods prevent the "inevitable" winning hand from actually winning?
