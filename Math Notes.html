			<h4>Mortgage Math | Rule of 72.gcx</h4>
			<p class="mjx-clear">\(\log_{1+\frac{x}{100}} 2\): The log function for determining \(b^e = 2\) is similar to the equation \(72 \cdot \frac{1}{x}\)</p>

		<h3>Thomas Calculus</h3>

			<h4>Linear Approximations — x-squared and tangent.gcx</h4>
			<p>Graphs of the equation \(x^2\) and its derivative \(2x\). The equation \(t(x) = (2c)\cdot x - c^2\) is the tangent line when x = c. Graphing \(t(x)\) = \((2x)\cdot x\ -\ x^2\) produces \(x^2\).</p>
			<p>Thomas Calculus, P. 45</p>

			<h4>Thomas Calculus, Sec 2-3</h4>
			<p class="mjx-clear">\[\lim_{x\to c\ ±\ \delta} f(x) = L\ ±\ \epsilon\]</p>

		<h3>Calculus for Dummies</h3>

			<h4>First and Second Derivative Test.gcx ( Critical Numbers and Concavity )</h4>
			<p class="mjx-clear">\(f'(x) = 0\) yields critical numbers.</p>
			<p>Note that if one of the critical numbers of the graphed equation falls on x = 0, the mouse has to be on the y-axis to detect the value, because the axis and the graphed x = 0 are indistinguishable.</p>
			<p class="mjx-clear">f(x) is concave up (smile) when \( f''( f'(x) = 0 ) > 0 \); f(x) is concave down (frown) when \( f''( f'(x) = 0 ) < 0 \).</p>
			
			<h4>The Second Derivative Test (Unnecessary).gcx ( Critical Numbers and Concavity )</h4>
			<p class="mjx-clear">\(y = 2x-3x^{2/3}+4\)</p>
			<p>f'(x) shows that the slope is negative, it's getting less-negative, but it's getting less negative at a slowing pace.</p>
			
			<h4>Absolute Extrema on Closed Interval.gcx ( Critical Numbers and Concavity )</h4>
			<p class="mjx-clear">Using f'(x) and f''(x) to determine highest and lowest points of f(x).</p>
			
			<h4>First and Second Derivative using Difference Quotient and Calculator.gcx</h4>
			<p class="mjx-clear">Shows the difference quotient for first and second derivative for \(x^2\) and \(\cos x\). It also includes the second derivative using the GCX Menu &rarr; Equation &rarr; Differentiate option: \(\dfrac{d^2}{dx^2}\)</p>
			
			<h4>Figure 12-1 &mdash; The Maximum Volume of a Box.gcx</h4>
			<p class="mjx-clear">The 2-dimensional area of the 30x30 material \(a = 30^2 - 4h^2\) compared to the 3-dimensional volume of the same material \(v = (30-2h)^2 \cdot h\) as the 3rd dimension, h, increases from 0 to 15.</p>
			
			<h4>Figure 12-2 &mdash; The Maximum Area of a Corral.gcx</h4>
			<p>Solving this problem depends on understanding that you're working with two things referred to as length here: 1. Total length (L = 300) of the fence, 2. The length, y (or l), of one side of the corral.</p>
			<p class="mjx-clear">The equation L, \(300 = 4x + 3y\), provides the domain for x and y. A = w · l. The picture shows the width as 2x. l = L solved for y. So A = 2x · ( 300 - 4x ) / 3.</p>
			<p>The area function, A = l · w, is always \(kx^2\). Because y is always some percentage ( k ) of x. In the case of the circle, k = π.</p>
			
			<h4>Figure 12-3 &mdash; The Yo-Yo a Go-Go.gcx</h4>
			<p>The polynomial used to graph the yo-yo's position between t = [0,4] can be approximated by a cos function, like \(\small y=7.1\cdot \cos \left( 1.036x-.55 \right)+24\). The 3rd degree polynomial has a 1st degree 2nd derivative. But the cos function has successive derivatives that always stay in the transcendental family. Can that be? Yes! The derivatives really are very similar for the interval [0,4].</p>
			
			<p>Now the actual equation:</p>
			
			<p>
				\(h=x^{3}-6x^{2}+5x+30\)<br />
				\(v=3x^{2}-12x+5\)<br />
				\(s= \left|3x^{2}-12x+5\right| \)<br />
				\(a=6x-12\)<br />
			</p>

			<p>
				Max (or Min) Height &mdash; h( v(x) = 0 )<br />
				Displacement &mdash; h(4) - h(0);<br />
				Velocity (Average) &mdash; ( h(4) - h(0) ) / (4 - 0)<br />
				Max (or Min) Velocity &mdash; v( a(x) = 0 )<br />
				Distance &mdash; 1.1 + 14.2 + 1.1 = 16.4<br/>
				Speed (Distance/Time) &mdash; 16.4 / 4<br/>
				Max (or Min) Speed &mdash; |v( a(x) = 0 )|<br />
			</p>
			
			<h4>Figure 12-7 &mdash; Filling up a trough.gcx</h4>
			<p class="mjx-clear">\(\small v(t) = 5t\)<br />\(\small v(h) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot b \cdot h \cdot 10 = 5 \cdot \frac{24}{30} \cdot h \cdot h = 4h^{2}\)</p>
			<p class="mjx-clear">The variable b is measured as a proportion of h, just as y can always be measured as a proportion of x in a square: \( \small b \cdot h = (\frac{b}{h}\cdot h) \cdot h\) and \(\small b \cdot h = b \cdot (\frac{h}{b}\cdot b)\). Changing h in these equations does not change b. Either variable, h or b, could change without affecting the other. If you know, h and b, why can't you just use them in the original equation? Why does b necessarily change when h does?</p>
			<p class="mjx-clear">\(5t = 4h^2\) or \(h = \sqrt{\frac{5}{4}t}\)</p>
			
			<h4>Figure 12-8 &mdash; Calculus - A drive in the country.gcx</h4>
			<p class="mjx-clear">The author's explanation isn't anything I can understand, but I tried to work through the variables of the problem anyway. It seems to me s (distance) is changing according to t (time) using the equations I put in there.</p>	
			
			<h4>Figure 13-3 &mdash; Linear Approximations.gcx</h4>
			<p class="mjx-clear">This is similar to Thomas Calculus &mdash; Linear Approximations &mdash; x-squared and tangent. Generate a tangent line for a point on \(x^2\), approximating that segment of the curve.</p>
			
			
			<h4>Marginal Cost</h4>
			<p class="mjx-clear">Marginal Cost: h = 1 instead of 0.</p>
			
			<h4>Ch 14 &mdash; Riemann Sums</h4>

			<p class="mjx-clear">With the diagram above, it's easy to see how to calculate left, right, mid-point \(f(\frac{a_1 + a_2}{2}) \cdot \frac{b-a}{n} \), and trapezoidal \(\frac{f(a_1) - f(a_2)}{2} \cdot \frac{b-a}{n}\) Riemann sums. In this case, n = 5, and perhaps a = 2, b = 4. It's not necessary to see the real graph &mdash; the function being summed can be represented by the straight line.</p>
			
			<h4>Figure 15-1 - Simplified f and F.gcx</h4>
			<p class="mjx-clear">This shows how F gives the area under f. F is the integral of f; f is the derivative of F.</p>
			
			<h4>Figure 15-1 - x cubed and derivative with linear approximation.gcx</h4>
			<p>Not intuitive: F(x) does not look like it provides the area of f(x) to me. So I have to approximate it to confirm it's correct.</p>
			<p class="mjx-clear">Note: \(\small f'(x) = 6x \) of \(\small f(x) = 3x^2\) can be used to get a specific slope. But it's difficult to get the x value perfectly correct, so it's easier to tweak M directly once you've ball parked it with \(\small f'(x) = 6x \).</p>

		<h3>Notes</h3>
			
			<h4>Derivative of Abs X.gcx</h4> 
			<p class="mjx-clear">\( \dfrac{d}{dx} abs(x) \cdot x = abs(x) \), which I thought was interesting for some reason.</p>
			

			<h4>The Art of the Infinite: The Pleasures of Mathematics<br />Attacking Problems in Logarithms and Exponential Functions</h4>
			<p class="mjx-clear">The reduction of exponents to addition is fun. Think: \(2^3\) has \(2^{\ x-1}\) groups of ·· and \(2^{\ x-1} - 1\) addition signs. Or, more often, some other kind of separator. It's fun to consider that exponents of 3 are cubes, and that exponents > than 3 can be grouped in cubes.</p>
			
			<p class="mjx-clear">\(5^1\) would have 4 linking separators, but \(5^{1-1} = 1\). So the above note isn't quite right, because there is the conceptual shift in grouping. Internal separators is always G - 1.</p>
			
			<h4>Equal Percentages</h4>
			<p class="mjx-clear">Not intuitive: \( \small 80\% \cdot 12 = 80 \cdot 12\%\), because \( \small 80 \cdot 12 \cdot \frac{1}{100}\)</p>
			
			<h4>Implicit Conversion</h4>
			<p class="mjx-clear">Not intuitive: \(x \cdot x = x^2\), but \(\small kx \cdot kx = k^2x^2\). When x = 1, it's just \(\small k^2\), as in \(\small .5 \cdot .5 = .125\), which seems impossibly small to be a meaningful area. x is NOT equal to .5; when l or w (or both) = .5, the question is: half of what? Alternatively, it's always assumed that x is really k, and that what most people think of as x is always 1 &mdash; the unit is virtually implicit. (This is probably true, but not consistent with the model I think a lot of people have.)</p>
			
			<p>What's the difference? Because I can think of 5 as an independent integer without a unit. I struggle to do that when \(\small x^2\) produces a smaller number than its factors. It's also not just x = 1, but (x=1) · (x=1) = \(x^2\), or 1 square unit.</p>
			
			<h4>Thoughts on Learning Calculus</h4>
			<p>The difference quotient doesn't get you to Integral Calculus. Reversing a scalar into components isn't intuitive, and nothing about looking at a graph suggests to me that it's possibly the area of some other graph in a way that leads to calculus.</p>
			
			<h4>Fractions for x-squared</h4>
			<p>It's perhaps easier for a kid to see the effect of a fraction by using a 1 x 1 box, and showing how each fraction reduces a side of the area of the box.</p>
				
				
			<!-- Examples -->
			<p class="example mjx-clear">When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are \[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]</p>
