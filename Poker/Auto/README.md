## Poker/Auto

Writing code to auto-play poker.

### To-Do List
- ✓ Play n hands - n = 500,000
- Create a list of questions below:
  - ✓ Which hands win most often (when no one folds)
  - Is it necessary for auto play to have hands fold? No.
  - Is it worthwhile to play the same hand using every player as the dealer. Only if betting is calculated.
    - How do intermediate likelihoods prevent the "inevitable" winning hand from actually winning?
  - Is betting a "language" or is it "math"?
    - Other questions are about the players, and then, finally, about codifying the players. This is the only interesting modern question about the game.

- Include time stamp
  - Is it possible to affect the timing of the code components such that symptoms are present in a manner that is undetectable? No. But how subtle can they be? My assumption today is that they're not subtle at all, especially in systems dependent on time-sensitive elements.
    - This ultimately leads to the question: Is there anything mysterious (or interesting) about any system that isn't just *your* ignorance? My assumption is no, not in any system I will understand in my lifetime.
