# NYSE

Consider: 
Purchase stock at A and sell at B. B is 3% per year higher than A. The appreciation is perfectly linear.

Now consider fluctuating prices. Purchase additional shares when the stock prices is below the purchase price. Sell all shares when the stock price is above the purchase price.

Buy and hold wastes the money in the variable intervals.
