<sup>1</sup> I think a problem *with* my math textbook is that half of the math problems are missing their corresponding instructions for solving. Not even the answers are included. Think about it: 50% of the math problems in an *instructional* book have no instructions and no answers. Modern user experience and performance psychology are missing from these books, which is frustrating because they're supposed to be instructional, and they're supposedly edited and published every year. Plus, they're bizarrely expensive.

Much of daily-use math is symbolic—it's a language, which makes sharing it implicitly and unnecessarily tedius. I'm increasingly in favor of teaching math symbolism in conjunction with, but secondary to, the fundamental skills of addition and subtraction—Like a computer might do math.
