# Monty Hall

## Game
There are 3 doors. A contestant is offered a choice: pick a door. Once the contestant has chosen a door, one of the non-chosen doors is removed. Then the contestant is offered a second choice: pick the previously chosen door or the other remaining door.

The situation after the first choice is persuasively conveyed by a natural perception of equity. Think of the game show as another person. If you, as the contestant, choose a door with your first choice, the other person then has two doors. It should be immediately obvious that the other person has a better chance of winning whatever prize may be behind the doors.

Then a door is removed.

The other person, with two doors, always has at least one door without a prize, and removing it reduces his doors from two to one. And doing so creates the appearance of 1:1 odds against the contestant, **incorrectly** equalizing the contestant's perception of inferior equity. However, the likelihood created by the contestant's initial choice is unchanged. It's as if the other person still has two doors and a 2-in-3 likelihood of having the door with a prize.

Then the second choice: pick either the previously chosen door or the other person's remaining door.

### Choices

**Choice**: Select door 1, 2, or 3

Contestant — Door 1 (33% chance of prize)<br />
Other person — Door 2 and Door 3 (66% chance of prize)

**Then**: Either door 2 or door 3 MUST NOT have the prize, so remove either door that does not.

**Choice**: Select either the previously chosen door or the other person's remaining door.

### Strategy
The best strategy is to choose a door and then claim the other person's two doors with the second choice.

Whatever one believes, the second choice has odds of either 1:1 or 1:2. Both are consistent with the suggested strategy. Choosing the other person's door is always sensible.


## Explanation

**Choice 1**: Only 3 things can happen:
- Pick door 1.
- Pick door 2.
- Pick door 3.

**Choice 2**: Only 3 things can happen:<br />
If you picked door 1, then the 3 events are: 

- Picked door 1, it has a prize. Either door 2 or door 3 was closed.
- Picked door 1, it doesn't have a prize. Either door 2 or door 3 was closed, whichever didn't have the prize.
- Picked door 1, it doesn't have a prize. Either door 2 or door 3 was closed, whichever didn't have the prize.

The symbolic math explaining this is ridiculous. I literally ruined my career over it. I hope this helps someone else.
