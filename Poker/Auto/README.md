## Poker/Auto

Writing code to auto-play poker.

### To-Do List
- Play n hands. 
- Include time stamp
- Create list of questions
  - Which hands win most often (when no one folds)
  - Is it necessary for auto play to have hands fold, or is "folding" actually a secondary component of the hand?
  - How do intermediate likelihoods prevent the "inevitable" winning hand from actually winning?
  - Is betting a "language" or is it "math"? (This is the only interesting modern question about the game. All the other questions are about the players, and then, finally, about codifying the players.)
