## Game
There are 3 doors. A contestant is offered a choice: pick a door. Once the contestant has chosen a door, one of the non-chosen doors is removed. Then the contestant is offered a second choice: pick your door or the other remaining door.

The initial situation is persuasively shared in the perception of equity. Think of the game show as another person. If you, as the contestant, choose a door, the other person now has two doors. It should be immediately obvious that the other person has a better chance of winning whatever prize may be behind the doors.

Then a door is removed.

The other person, with two doors, always has at least one door without a prize, and removing it reduces his doors from two to one. This creates the appearance of 1:1 odds against the contestant, and the perception of inferior equity is **incorrectly** equalized. However, the likelihood created by the contestants initial choice is unchanged. It's as if the other person still has two doors and a 2/3 likelihood of having the winning door.

Then the second choice: pick either your door or the other person's remaining door.

### Choices

**Choice**: Select door 1, 2, or 3

You — Door 1 (33% chance of prize)<br />
Other person — Door 2 and Door 3 (66% chance of prize)

**Then**: Either door 2 or door 3 MUST NOT have the prize, so remove it.

**Choice**: Select either your door or the other person's remaining door.

### Strategy
Statistically, the best strategy is to choose a door and then claim the other person's two doors with the second choice.

Believing the second choice is either one of 1:2 or 1:1 shouldn't affect the strategy either—choosing the other person's door is always sensible. The odds are no worse for the contestant's lack of understanding by doing so.

## Computers

Computers (and the basic math they do) say the choose-and-swap strategy wins two-thirds, or 66%, of the time.
