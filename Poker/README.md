# Poker

Sit at a table of 6 people. The odds of winning each hand is 1 in 6.

If people fold, the odds improve from 1 in 6 to, at best, 1 in 1, when you're the only person who hasn't folded.

### Basic Theory
Most of the elementary theory on poker explains why folding is usually a good idea. Starting hands can have
* low values
* few "outs"
etc.

### Betting Theory (Expected Value)
Some theory explains how to bet to "communicate" the value of your hand to convince other people to fold.
