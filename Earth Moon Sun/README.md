## How the Earth and Moon move
Everything is counter clockwise. Learning more about the Earth, moon, and Sun gave me anxiety; It gave me real Space-is-not-like-that-PBS-special-I-saw-as-a-kid anxiety.

Here's a hint: The Sun doesn't rise. The Earth--all 24,000 miles of its circumference--spins around at 1000mph so that you can see the Sun again each day. Light, dark, light, dark ... 24 hours ... spin, spin, spin. Enjoy the ride!

Also, the moon isn't only out at night. And though it appears to be going the same direction as the Sun appears to be going (E to W), it isn't. The moon is going the same way we are. We're just going faster.

## Gravity

A tennis ball weighs 2 ounces. A ford fusion weighs 3500 pounds or 28000 tennis balls. Hold 1 tennis ball in each hand. Drop them at the same time. They hit the ground at the same time. Add 1 tennis ball to just 1 hand (so now you're holding 3, 1 in one hand and 2 in the other). Repeat. The tennis balls all reach the ground at the same time. Keep adding tennis balls to one hand until you have 28000 of them. 

A single air particle has less mass than both a tennis ball and a feather. But a lot of air particles add up, just like a lot of tennis balls add up. Getting hit with 1 tennis ball isn't like getting hit with 28000. The other 27999 make a difference. A feather has less mass than all the air particles it hits. Gravity is moving the masses of everything involved (tennis ball(s), feather, and air), but the things are not equally massive, so the most massive things sink, just like rocks in water. The tennis ball, the feather, and the air, are all falling toward Earth at the rate of 9.8 m/s. Or something.

No vacuum needed to convince someone that a bowling ball and a fusion hit the ground at the same time?

I think the feather/bowling ball demonstration done by NASA (or whomever owns that giant vacuum) is neat, but it's a terrible introduction to Physics for people with ordinary experience in every-day life.

The shocking part about gravity isn't that it accelerates everything similarly. It's that the acceleration is continual. Most things, like cars and planes, have limits to their acceleration. They can increase the rate of change of velocity until they can't. Gravity doesn't seem to have any such limits. (In my pre-physics understanding.) The almost unlimited acceleration gravity provides is shocking in the same way that it's shocking that the Earth—all 24,000 miles of its diameter—is going faster than a jet.
