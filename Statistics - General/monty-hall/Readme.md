# Monty Hall

There are 3 doors. A contestant is offered a choice: pick a door. Once the contestant has chosen a door, one of the two other doors are removed. Then the contestant is offered a second choice: pick your door or the other remaining door.

The statistics is effectively shared in the perception of equity. Think of the game show as another person. If you, as the contestant, choose a door, the other person now has two doors. It should be immediately obvious that the other person has a better chance of winning whatever prize may be behind the doors.

The other person has two doors. One of his or her doors must not have a prize. That's the door that is removed.

Then the second choice: do you want your door or the other person's door? 

Removing a door is a trick. The second choice offers you the opportunity of having the other person's two doors instead of the door you have, reversing the circumstances created by your first choice. By first removing one of the other person's doors, it merely seems that you have a 50/50 chance of winning against the other person who then also has just one door.


**Choice**: Select door 1, 2, or 3

You: Door 1 (33% chance of winning)<br />
Other person: Door 2 and Door 3 (66% chance of winning)

Either door 2 or door 3 MUST NOT have the prize, so remove it.

**Choice**: Select the other person's door. You have 2 doors (though a door with no prize was removed).

So, statistically, the best strategy is to choose a door at random, and then claim the other person's two doors with your second choice.
