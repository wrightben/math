### Quarterback

The football pass is a trajectory problem. When the other variables are fixed, **the best launch angle seems to be between 41 and 46 degrees** when the football is thrown between 10-100 mph, with lower angles coinciding with lower speeds.

Training a player to throw at a 43 degree angle is sensible.

I'm not sure how fast junior or amateur football players can throw yet. Baseball pitchers regularly throw 90+ mph fastballs. A pitcher's arm can flow through nearly any path of motion because the fingers have excellent control of the ball. A football is more difficult to accelerate because of control issues.

### My Experience

I was able to estimate from my experience that my ball speed is about 38mph. From 6 feet, the ball will hit the ground in .6 seconds. A perfectly horizontal pass across the 8 yards of my living room must be completed in .6 seconds (or less), which puts the velocity at around 48 feet/sec or (32 mph).

Using the best angle (43), 100 feet isn't possible at a velocity less than 38mph. I'm likely generating a little more velocity (38 instead of 32) from my coil when I throw outside. 

#### Velocity on distance
- 38 mph, 102.6 feet, 43 degrees
- 50 mph, 173.1 feet, 43 degrees

#### Angle of attack on distance
- 50 mph, 154.6 feet (51 yards), 30 degrees
- 50 mph, 165.5 feet (55 yards), 35 degrees
- 50 mph, 173.1 feet (57 yards), 43 degrees

### Conclusion

Throw fast. Velocity is the critical variable.

To maximize distance, the angle of attack is increasingly important, becoming most influential when speed is high and the expectation is maximum distance.
