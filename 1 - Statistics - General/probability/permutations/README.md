## Algorithms for generating permutations


### About this algorithm (factorial-permutations.pl)

#### Purpose

Knowing the value of nPr does not tell you what the permutations are. This code produces a string of permutations for a range between (a..[b..z]).

#### Practical Applications

With any completed factorial permutation string of non-duplicates, a new one can be created by map-and-replace. See the code on permutations in CodeEval folder.
