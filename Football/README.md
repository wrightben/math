# Football

### Quarterback

The football pass is a trajectory problem. When the other variables are fixed, **the best launch angle seems to be between 41 and 46 degrees** when the football is thrown between 10-100 mph, with lower angles coinciding with lower speeds.

Training a player to throw at a 43 degree angle is sensible.

I'm not sure how fast junior or amateur football players can throw yet. Baseball pitchers regularly throw 90+ mph fastballs. A pitcher's arm can flow through nearly any path of motion because the fingers have excellent control of the ball. A football is more difficult to accelerate because of control issues.

### My Experience

I was able to estimate from my experience that my ball speed is about 38mph. From 6 feet, the ball will hit the ground in .6 seconds. A perfectly horizontal pass across the 8 yards of my living room must be completed in .6 seconds (or less), which puts the velocity at around 48 feet/sec or (32 mph).

Using the best angle (43), 100 feet isn't possible at a velocity less than 38mph. I'm likely generating a little more velocity (38 instead of 32) from my coil when I throw outside. 

#### Velocity on distance
- 38 mph, 102.6 feet, 43 degrees
- 50 mph, 173.1 feet, 43 degrees

#### Angle of attack on distance <sup>1</sup>
- 50 mph, 154.6 feet (51 yards), 30 degrees
- 50 mph, 165.5 feet (55 yards), 35 degrees
- 50 mph, 173.1 feet (57 yards), 43 degrees

### Conclusion

1. Throw fast. Velocity is the critical variable.
2. When maximizing distance, optimizing launch angle is increasingly important as speed increases.
