## Poker/Auto

Writing code to auto-play poker.

### To-Do List
- ✓ Play n hands: n = 500,000
- Create a list of questions below:
  - ✓ Which hands win most often (when no one folds): Two Pair, 30% of hands
  - ✓ Is it necessary for auto play to have hands fold? No.
  - ✓ Is it worthwhile to play the same hand using every player as the dealer. Only if betting is calculated.
    - How do intermediate likelihoods prevent the "inevitable" winning hand from actually winning?
  - Do the best hole cards usually become the winning hand?
  - Is betting a "language" or is it "math"?
    - Other questions are about the players, and then, finally, about codifying the players. This is the only interesting modern question about the game.
