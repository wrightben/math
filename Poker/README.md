# Poker

Sit in a Texas Hold'em game of 6 people. The likelihood of winning each hand is 1 in 6.

As people fold, the likelihood of winning improves from 1 in 6 to, at best, 1 in 1, when you're the only person who hasn't folded.

### Basic Theory
Most of the elementary theory on poker explains why folding is usually a good idea: Usually because your cards will not make the best hand.

### Betting Theory (Expected Value)
Some theory explains how to bet to communicate the value of your hand, usually to convince other people to fold. But sometimes to convince others to bet more.

### Game Theory
Because the 6 players do not know each others' hands, communicating and sometimes feigning values is a part of play.
