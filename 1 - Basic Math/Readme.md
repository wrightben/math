- **Addition Multiplication Exponents.numbers** — A simple example of how these operations are connected.
- **Complicated Exponents.numbers** — 2 raised to the power of 1, 1.05, 1.10, and so on, up to 2. 
  -  2<sup>1</sup>, 2<sup>x</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup>: The symbology suggests x can be a non-integer: 2<sup>(1.05)</sup> = 2<sup>(21/20)</sup>
-  **Cubed Root Example.numbers** - <sup>3</sup>√180, or log<sub>x</sub> 180 = 3, is just repeated division, where the correct answer is a row ending in 1. Further evidence that *language* has subordinated *learning*.

## Miscellaneous
- 12% · 80 = 12 · 80%, because of the *implied* division by 100. The language of percentages may change the order of the spoken problem and the perception of it. Which would you rather have? 12% · 80 or 80% · 12. This type of linguistic grouping reduces clarity in many instructional explanations, but it helps in creating punchlines.
