## Game
There are 3 doors. A contestant is offered a choice: pick a door. Once the contestant has chosen a door, one of the two doors that were not chosen are removed. Then the contestant is offered a second choice: pick your door or the other remaining door.

The statistics is persuasively shared in the perception of equity. Think of the game show as another person. If you, as the contestant, choose a door, the other person now has two doors. It should be immediately obvious that the other person has a better chance of winning whatever prize may be behind the doors.

The other person, with two doors, always has at least one without a prize, and removing it creates the perception that he or she now has only one door.

Then the second choice: do you want your door or the other person's door?

### Choices

**Choice**: Select door 1, 2, or 3

You — Door 1 (33% chance of prize)<br />
Other person — Door 2 and Door 3 (66% chance of prize)

Either door 2 or door 3 MUST NOT have the prize, so remove it.

**Choice**: Select either your door or the other person's two doors. (One was removed, but it was one without a prize. A contestant with two doors always has at least one without a prize.)

Statistically, the best strategy is to choose a door, and then claim the other person's two doors with your second choice.

## Computers

Computers (and the basic math they do) say a choose-and-swap strategy wins two-thirds, or 66%, of the time.
