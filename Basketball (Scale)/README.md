### Nespresso Scale

.15

### Required
1. Nespresso Shot Glass
2. Nespresso Pod - Any flavor
3. Cloth tape measure
4. Table

### Notes

I cannot make every free throw or 3-pointer at any scale. 10 in a row is nearly impossible. At either scale, making any single long shot is somehow more interesting than making a single regular free throw.

I was able to make a couple 15' free throws in the mini game. Clarification: I stood 15' from a nespresso glass and threw a nespresso pod into it. To scale, that's like 100 yards or something. ;)
