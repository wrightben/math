## Game
There are 3 doors. A contestant is offered a choice: pick a door. Once the contestant has chosen a door, one of the non-chosen doors is removed. Then the contestant is offered a second choice: pick your door or the other remaining door.

The statistics is persuasively shared in the perception of equity. Think of the game show as another person. If you, as the contestant, choose a door, the other person now has two doors. It should be immediately obvious that the other person has a better chance of winning whatever prize may be behind the doors.

The other person, with two doors, always has at least one door without a prize, and removing it reduces his doors from two to one. However, when a door without a prize is removed, the perception of inferior equity is **incorrectly** equalized.

Then the second choice: pick either your door or the other person's door.

### Choices

**Choice**: Select door 1, 2, or 3

You — Door 1 (33% chance of prize)<br />
Other person — Door 2 and Door 3 (66% chance of prize)

**Then**: Either door 2 or door 3 MUST NOT have the prize, so remove it. This does not reduce the 66% chance that the other person's remaining door has a prize behind it.

**Choice**: Select either your door or the other person's two doors. (A door was removed, but it was a door without a prize. A contestant with two doors always has at least one without a prize.)

### Strategy
Statistically, the best strategy is to choose a door and then claim the other person's two doors with the second choice.

Believing the second choice is either one of 1:2 or 1:1 shouldn't affect the strategy either—choosing the other person's door is always sensible. The odds are no worse for the contestant's lack of understanding by doing so.

## Computers

Computers (and the basic math they do) say the choose-and-swap strategy wins two-thirds, or 66%, of the time.
