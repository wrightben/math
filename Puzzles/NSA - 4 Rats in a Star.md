# RATS x 4 = STAR

Each instance of a letter stands for the same digit, no two letters represent the same digit, and R cannot be 0. Which digits do the four letters represent?

### Factors

It helped me to be able to see the factors of 4.

1 · 4 = 4<br />
2 · 4 = 8<br />
3 · 4 = 12<br />
4 · 4 = 16<br />
5 · 4 = 20<br />
6 · 4 = 24<br />
7 · 4 = 28<br />
8 · 4 = 32<br />
9 · 4 = 36

### Step 1

**R != 0**

( [1,2] A T [4,8] ) x 4 = [4,8] T A [1,2]

If R cannot be zero, it also cannot be greater than 2, because any greater number would result in a carry.

**R = [1,2]**<br />
* A = [0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] when R = [1]; S = [4,5,6,7, ...]<br />
* A = [0,1,3,4] when R = [2]; S = [8, ...]<br />

When R = 2, A < 5; When A >= 5, A will carry to R, pushing R from 8 to 10, which isn't possible.

### Step 2

With the possibilities in Step 1, it might seem obvious to follow the easier path for Step 2. Consider R = 2, and eliminate the smaller set of combinations: R = [2], A = [0,1,3,4]. There are 25 possible combinations when R = 2 and assuming S = 8.

### Step 3

Understanding what RATS = STAR really means makes the puzzle very easy to solve. With 25 combinations, it's possible to list them and multiply them by 4. Simple.

### Notes

It's also possible to do some division and use the factors to figure out the answer is *2178*.
