# RATS x 4 = STAR

Each instance of a letter stands for the same digit, no two letters represent the same digit, and R cannot be 0. Which digits do the four letters represent?

### Step 1:

R != 0

[1,2] ? ? [4,8] x 4 = [4,8] ? ? [1,2]

If R cannot be zero, it also cannot be greater than 2, because any greater number would result in a carry.

R = [1,2]<br />
A = [0,2,3,4,5,6,7] when R = [1]; S = [4+, ... <br />
A = [0,1,3,4] when R = [2]; S = [8+, ...<br />

Just as a note, the most that can carry to R from A is 1, no matter what T is.
