<sup>1</sup> I think a problem *with* my math textbook is that it's poorly written. It's troublesome that it includes many math problems without their corresponding instructions for solving. Even the answers aren't included. Modern user experience and performance psychology are missing from these books, which is surprising because they're bizarrely expensive, and supposedly edited and published annually.
