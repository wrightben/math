# Poker

Sit at a table of 6 people. The likelihood of winning each hand is 1 in 6.

As people fold, the likelihood of winning improves from 1 in 6 to, at best, 1 in 1, when you're the only person who hasn't folded.

### Basic Theory
Most of the elementary theory on poker explains why folding is usually a good idea: Usually because your cards will not make the best hand.

### Betting Theory (Expected Value)
Some theory explains how to bet to communicate the value of your hand, usually to convince other people to fold. But sometimes to convince others to bet more.

### Game Theory
Because the 6 players do not know each others' hands, communicating and sometimes feigning values is a part of play.

## Auto Play and Analysis
I've been aware of poker tools that calculate odds of various scenarios for almost 30 years. Still, computers are faster and I know how to program now, so getting answers to questions about poker scenarios is still fun. And the programming part is good practice for entry-level statistics and chained processesâ€”a precursor for things like machine learning.

Once you've created all of the scenarios you can think of, try playing with all of the cards face up. See how many times you can predict which hole cards will win any particular hand.
