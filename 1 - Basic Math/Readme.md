- **Addition Multiplication Exponents.numbers** — A simple example of how these operations are connected.
- **Complicated Exponents.numbers** — 2 raised to the power of 1, 1.05, 1.10, and so on, up to 2. 
  -  2^1, 2^x, 2^2: The symbology suggests x can be a non-integer.
  -  2^(1.05) = 2^(21/20)
-  **Cubed Root Example.numbers** - <sup>3</sup>√180 ... is a table problem of division equal to n * 3 operations, where the correct answer is a row ending in 1.
  - <sup>3</sup>√180 is symbolic for log<sub>x</sub> 180 = 3, further evidence that *language* has subordinated *learning*.
