# NYSE

Consider: 
Purchase stock at A and sell at B. B is 3% per year higher than A. The appreciation is perfectly linear and positive.

Now consider fluctuating prices. Purchase additional shares when the stock price is below the purchase price. Sell all shares when the stock price is above the purchase price.

Buy and hold strategies do not exploit the variable intervals.
