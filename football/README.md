### Quarterback

Major league pitchers regularly throw 90+ mph fastballs. A pitcher's arm can flow through nearly any patch of motion because the fingers have excellent control of the ball. A football is more difficult to accelerate because of control issues.

The football pass is a trajectory problem. When the other variables are fixed, *the best launch angle seems to be between 41 and 46 degrees* when the football is thrown between 10-100 mph, with lower angles coinciding with lower speeds.

Training a player to throw at a 43 degree angle is sensible. I'm not sure how fast junior or amateur players can throw yet.
