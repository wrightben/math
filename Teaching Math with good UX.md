## Teaching Math using great user experience.

Much of daily-use math is symbolic. Symbolic math is a language, which complicates the otherwise very simple and intuitive *actual* math from basic addition to basic Calculus.

Becoming comfortable with math requires practice. Traditional math textbooks are little help. They're written in a manner that makes them difficult to understand. If that doesn't seem discouraging, remember that half of the math problems are missing their corresponding instructions for solving. Not even the answers are included. Think about that: **Half** of the math problems in *instructional* math books sold to *students* have no instructions and no answers. 

Teachers, students, parents, and taxpayers in the U.S. tolerate this, even as we collectively encourage young people to pursue education, especially in math-dependent degrees, and allocate millions to help them.

Khan Academy, unlike most textbooks, has simplified math instruction. The problems are less difficult to understand. They've incorporated modern user experience in the presentation of examples and use rewards to encourage practice. However, they recently changed their once-beautiful UI that made the entirety of math visible, and buried it in text like a traditional textbook again.

The improvement I'd suggest to Khan Academy is teaching math symbolism in conjunction with, but secondary to, the fundamental skills of addition and subtractionâ€”Like a computer might do math. Logs, as my primary example, are essentially division, though their symbolism makes them seem complicated.
