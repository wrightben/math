# Poker

Sit at a table of 6 people. The odds of winning each hand is 1 in 6.

If people fold, the odds improve from 1 in 6 to, at best, 1 in 1, when you're the only person who hasn't folded.

### Basic Theory
Most of the elementary theory on poker explains why folding is usually a good idea. Starting hands can have
* low values
* few "outs"
etc.

### Betting Theory (Expected Value)
Some theory explains how to bet to "communicate" the value of your hand to convince other people to fold. In some cases, under valuing your hand can increase the opponents' bets, improving the economic value of the play.

### Game Theory Nonsense
Because the 6 players do not know each others' hands, communicating or feigning values is a primary component of play.
