## Poker/Auto

Writing code to auto-play poker.

### To-Do List
- ✓ Play n hands - n = 500,000
- Create a list of questions below:
  - ✓ Which hands win most often (when no one folds)
  - Is it necessary for auto play to have hands fold? No. It can be calculated afterward, since hole cards are only relevant as players fold.
    - Possible to play the same hand from every position, with every player as the dealer.
    - How do intermediate likelihoods prevent the "inevitable" winning hand from actually winning?
  - Is betting a "language" or is it "math"? (This is the only interesting modern question about the game. All the other questions are about the players, and then, finally, about codifying the players.)
---

- Include time stamp
  - Is it possible to affect the timing of the code components such that symptoms are present in a manner that is undetectable? No. But how subtle can they be? My assumption today is that they're not subtle at all, especially in systems dependent on time-sensitive elements.
    - This ultimately leads to the question: Is there anything mysterious (or interesting) about any system that isn't just *your* ignorance? My assumption is no, not in any system I will understand in my lifetime.
