### Quarterback

The football pass is a trajectory problem. When the other variables are fixed, **the best launch angle seems to be between 41 and 46 degrees** when the football is thrown between 10-100 mph, with lower angles coinciding with lower speeds.

Training a player to throw at an angle between 30-43 degrees seems sensible.

I'm not sure how fast junior or amateur football players can throw yet. While a baseball can be thrown with any natural arm motion, because the fingers have excellent control of the ball, a football is much more difficult to control. The football's size, shape, weight, and especially the torque required to create the spiral, dictate the path of the arm (and the strength required).

### My Experience

I was able to estimate from [my experience](https://www.instagram.com/p/CL-KydtHJ3j/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) that my ball speed is about 38mph. From 6 feet, the ball will hit the ground in .6 seconds. A perfectly horizontal pass across the 8 yards of my living room must be completed in .6 seconds (or less), which puts the velocity at around 48 feet/sec or (32 mph).

Using the best angle (43), 100 feet isn't possible at a velocity less than 38mph. I'm likely generating a little more velocity (38 instead of 32) from my coil when I throw outside. 

#### Velocity on distance
- 38 mph, 102.6 feet, 43 degrees
- 50 mph, 173.1 feet, 43 degrees

#### Angle of attack on distance <sup>1</sup>
- 50 mph, 154.6 feet (51 yards), 30 degrees
- 50 mph, 165.5 feet (55 yards), 35 degrees
- 50 mph, 173.1 feet (57 yards), 43 degrees

### Conclusion

1. Throw fast. Velocity is the critical variable.
  - To throw fast, the arm has to move fast.
3. When maximizing distance, optimizing launch angle is increasingly important as speed increases.

## Notes on throwing a Football

The position of the arm over the shoulder, like a hand of a clock, determines the angle of the ball toward the sky. The speed of the arm creates the velocity. The angle of the hand (left-right) controls the nose of the ball; The nose should to be pointing at the target. This point is important, but possibly the least conscious component of an accurate throw. The torque applied by the fingers to the laces creates the spiral. The laces are a lever. As the arm travels through a natural throwing motion, the conscious effort to apply torque to the laces will naturally create a cross-body, thumbs-down arm motion.

If the motion of the arm is correct and unchanging, the feeling of the arm motion is more like moving in high-speed rather than pushing hard. A coach might say, "move your arm faster", but a beginner probably can't move faster correctly without first practicing the correct motion.
